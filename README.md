# Base-L
Is meant as a core layer to your workflow. Its a true CSS framework following
the ITCSS guidelines outlined by [Harry Roberts](http://www.csswizardry.com) in
this [seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OKZOV-iLj4)

## Usage
You can include the core.css file in your project as a starting place or use the
framework as a boilerplate for your overall design.

## Scope
Base-L is only part of the equation... It takes what Harry talks about being the
main layers and groups them into three sections.

1. Core
2. Theme
3. Other/utilities

By doing this we can break out the framework from the design. This is the main
focus of Base-L. It provides you with a solid starting point for your projects.
To much, you can also just include the **Core** layer to easily build your work
off of. We also provide a common **Utilities** layer to start from.

The **Theme** however is left up to you!

#### Core
This is essentially your **generic** and **base** layers as well as some global
**objects**.

#### Theme
This is all of your none global **objects** and individual **components** as
well as any **theme** specific stuff

#### Utilities
This is your catch all things that are overly specific, the rest of the layers.

## Why
Base-L was designed with applications in mind. Developed in conjunction with the
popular forum application [phpBB](http://www.phpbb.org). It lends it self
beautifully to the project improving its code base and simplifying the process
of designing and creating rich, beautiful custom themes.
